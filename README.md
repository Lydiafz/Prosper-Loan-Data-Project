# Prosper-Loan-Data-Project

The current data analysis project is one of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree projects. 
The prosper loan data was obtained from  https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv, 
which includes the loan information from Nov.2005 to March, 2014. 
Using this data set, the current project intends to conduct some exploratory analysis to investigate the loan 
fluctuation along with time, the distribution of borrowers â€˜prosper ratings, the potential influence factors on 
loan status etc.
